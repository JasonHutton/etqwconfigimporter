1. About
================================
Because ETQW by default does not import configs from BaseETQW to mods,
and the directory where configs are stored is somewhat hidden away...
ETQW Config Importer simply makes importing your BaseETQW configs as 
simple and painless as possible, short of doing it from within ETQW.
(Which is a problem that's being worked on as well.)
ETQW Config Importer is a Windows-only application at present, and requires
Microsoft's .NET Framework, available here: http://www.microsoft.com/NET/

2. Features
================================
* Detects ETQW's userpath automatically.
* Detects active ETQW Profiles.
* Detects mods with profiles.
* Copies BaseETQW configs(*.cfg) to one or more mod directories.

3. Installation
================================
None required. Just run it.
Requires Microsoft's .NET Framework: http://www.microsoft.com/NET/

4. Instructions
================================
* You must have started the mod you're trying to import configs for,
  at least once before. (So the proper directories are already created.)
* Start ETQW Config Importer.
* Most likely ETQW Config Importer has detected everything automatically.
* Select the ETQW Profile name you wish to work with, if you have more
  than one. If you have only one, it will be auto-selected already.
* Select which mod(s) you would like to import BaseETQW configs to.
* Click Import. You should be done now.
* If ETQW Profiles or mods do not show up, you may have to point
  ETQW Config Importer to the correct User Path directory, manually.

5. Known Issues
================================
* None
